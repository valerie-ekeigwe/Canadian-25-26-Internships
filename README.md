## Contributing

Spotted a new posting or a dead link? Please open a PR:

1. Keep the **table structure** and columns exactly as-is.  
2. Use the **official** careers/program page (no third-party listings).  
3. Fill **Posted**/**Deadline** from the page when available; otherwise use **Rolling/unspecified**.  
4. Normalize locations (e.g., `Toronto, ON`; `Vancouver, BC`; `Seattle, WA`).  
5. Sort rows by **Deadline (asc)**, then **Company**.  
6. Update the **Status** badge to Closed (red) if the official page shows closed/expired.

---

## Update policy

When this list is re-run/maintained:

- Re-verify each link; remove **404/closed** roles or mark **Closed**.
- Update **dates** from official pages.
- Add **new** Canada-based engineering internships (or US roles that **explicitly** accept Canadian student applicants).
- Keep the **table format** stable.

---

## Changelog

- **2025-08-09**: Expanded coverage; added **Status** column with badges; added AMD, CAE, BlackBerry/QNX, AtkinsRéalis, BMO tech intern; clarified bank programs; cleaned notes.  
- **2025-08-09 (earlier)**: Initial Canada-first list with SWE, Mechanical, Mechatronics/Embedded, ECE/Hardware, Programs/Fellowships, and Events.

---

### Notes & caveats

- This repo is strictly **engineering** (SWE, Mechanical, Mechatronics/Robotics/Embedded, ECE/Hardware).  
- **US roles** appear only when the official page **explicitly** says Canadians can apply (global/remote or explicit eligibility).
