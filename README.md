A Canada-first, continuously updated list of **engineering internships** and **student programs** for students in Canada (plus select **US roles that clearly accept Canadian applicants**).  
All links go to official company/program pages.

> Sorting: by **Deadline** ascending, then **Company**. If no explicit date is listed on the official page, fields show **Rolling/unspecified**.

### Notes & caveats

- This repo is strictly **engineering** (SWE, Mech, Mechatronics/Robotics/Embedded, ECE/Hardware).  
- **US roles** will only appear when the official page **explicitly** states Canadian student eligibility (global/remote from Canada or explicit mention of Canada/intl students).
