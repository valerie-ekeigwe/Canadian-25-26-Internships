_Last updated: **{{ generated_at }}**_  

A Canada-first, continuously updated list of **engineering internships**, **law and consulting roles**, and **student programs** for Canadian students — plus select **US roles that explicitly accept Canadian applicants**.  

All links point to official company or program pages.

> **Sorting:** By **Deadline** (ascending), then **Company**. If no date is listed on the official page, “Rolling/unspecified” is shown.  
> **Status:** Automatically updated to Open or Closed based on the official source.

- US roles are included **only** if the official posting explicitly states Canadians are eligible (global eligibility, remote from Canada, or explicit mention).
